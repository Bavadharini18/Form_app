# My React Native App

Welcome to my first React Native app! This app is built using Expo and includes some simple features like navigation, calendar integration, and checkboxes.

## Features

- **Expo Router**: Simple and intuitive navigation between screens.
- **Expo Calendar**: Integration with the device's calendar to manage events.
- **Expo Checkbox**: Customizable checkboxes for better user interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- You have installed [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- You have a mobile device or emulator to run the app

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the App

To start the development server and run the app:

1. Start the Expo development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. Open the app on your device using the Expo Go app, or on an emulator by following the on-screen instructions.

## Usage

- **Navigation**: Use the Expo Router to navigate between different screens.
- **Calendar**: Access and manage calendar events using the Expo Calendar API.
- **Checkboxes**: Interact with the checkboxes in the app for various user inputs.


# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
